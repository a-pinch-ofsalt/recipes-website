    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Omurice is runny egg over rice. It is a japanese dish and pretty popular with westerners. It is very delicious. Do not forget the demi-glace.</p>
    <p>Basically you first scramble the egg and then let it develop a thin solid layer, then fold it up and plop it on a mound of rice. Then the waiter takes a knife and slices down the middle, making the egg open up and waterfall over your rice (like a volcano!) which makes for a good tiktok video.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Like 3 eggs</li>
        <li>Pork, beef or chicken rice</li>
        <li>Demi-glace sauce</li>
        <li>Skillet</li>
        <li>Probably chopsticks</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put your rice in a neat little mound on your serving dish.</li>
        <li>Crack the eggs into the pan and quickly swirl them with chopsticks, frantically sliding the skillet back and forth.</li>
        <li>When the eggs develop a thin layer at the bottom, tilt the skillet and fold the eggs into a corner of the skillet.</li>
        <li>Flip it using <a href="https://youtu.be/Uu5zGHjRaMo?t=100" target="_blank">this method.</a> Do this a few times so that the eggs cooks a little more.</li>
        <li>Plop it onto your rice mound and slice the runny egg pocket open</li>
        <li>Enjoy</li>
    </ol>
